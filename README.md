# Keylogger
Basic Keylogger used to record Keystrokes
## Description
This software program otherwise referred to as a keylogger is used to record and capture keystrokes,take screenshots and record the audio of the system in which it is present.
This keylogger has been developed entirely using python due to its easier understandibility by humans.
The challenges I faced was the logger recorded the backspace key as "Key.backspace" and i hope to fix it
REMEMBER: To use this keylogger for ethical purposes only!!!
## Installation
Embed the keylogger in a document and send the document through mail once downloaded it will be automatically installed.
ONLY USE FOR ETHICAL PURPOSES!!
